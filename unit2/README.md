In this exercise, we will review one of the problems of vector sampling methods. Consider the random variables X_1,...,X_n ∼ N(0,1) and assume that X ̅_n is the sample mean for the first n samples. Draw the value of X ̅_n according to n for n = 1,...,10^4. Repeat this work for X_1,...,X_n ∼ Cauchy and draw two curves in a graph and compare them. Explain the difference.
