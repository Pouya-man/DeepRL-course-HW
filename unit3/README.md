In this exercise, we want to use importance sampling to calculate the probability that a random variable with normal distribution has a value greater than 5.

We know that the probability equals.

Numerically compute the importance estimate for various sample sizes 0<n<1000. Plot the estimate against the sample size and compare it with the ground truth value.

The two figures below show the significance of the sampling estimate as a function of sample size (the selection of numbers is random, so the shapes provide different estimates). A good estimate can be obtained with a few hundred samples.
